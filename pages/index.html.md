title: Sitepress
---

Build amazing content websites inside any Ruby web framework, including Rails and Sinatra, or even as a static site.

## Why Sitepress?

Static site generators like [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) are great frameworks for compiling static websites and publishing them to the web, but what if you want to run a content site from within Rails or Sinatra?

Database-backed content management systems like [Refinery CMS](http://www.refinerycms.com) and [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org) are difficult to sync between development, test, staging, and production environments, making them difficult to use in multi-stage development or test-driven development workflows.

Projects like [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) make it possible to embed a small, basic site into Rails, but they lack powerful features like Frontmatter and Sitemap APIs required to make building non-trivial content sites possible.

Sitepress is the missing piece. It has all the powerful features you'd expect from a fully featured static site generator, like Frontmatter support and hierarchal page traversal, but it's capable of being embedded inside any Rails, Sinatra, or Rack app. Since all of the content is just a bunch of files, its easy to incorporate Sitepress into a multi-stage or test-driven work environment.
